<h1>Project-4 - Twitbook</h1>
The fifth and individual project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive. Twitbook is an app to let users to sign up, edit profile, post(twit), like, unlike and comment other users' posts.

<h2>Technologies used</h2>

<h2>Process/Approach</h2>
I wanted to build a website similar to Twitter with Facebook's color theme, so I decided to build Twitbook with the MERN Stack

<h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
Twitbook still has some bugs such as updating user's profile, following another user and getting the liked posts to show up on a user's profile.

<h2>Biggest Wins/Challenges</h2>
<h3>Wins</h3>
I was able to build the MVP using the MERN Stack as I wanted to and implement some other teachnologies in the app.
<h3>Challenges</h3>
Since I'm more comfortable with Frant End, building a Full Stack app isn't easy for me. 

<h2>Planned Implementation</h2>
I'm planning to implement the following feature where one user can follow another user and change the theme of the app using Sass.
